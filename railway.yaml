## Alternative: railway.toml (Create this file in repo)

# If you want to deploy from GitHub repo instead of Docker image:
# Create a file called railway.toml and push to GitHub

[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile.n8n"

[deploy]
startCommand = "n8n start"
healthcheckPath = "/healthz"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"

# You'll need to create Dockerfile.n8n with:
# FROM n8nio/n8n:latest
